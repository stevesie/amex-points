# Maximize Your Amex Statement Credit

If you prefer using your American Express reward points on statement credits, you need to [select purchases from your activity](https://rewards.americanexpress.com/myca/loyalty/us/rewards/edrredemption/rocs/getedreligiblerocs?request_type=authreg_mr&Face=en_US&sorted_index=0&intlink=us-ser-soa-accnthub-rewards-yourcharges) to redeem, subject to your available points, and are refunded the value.  If you're like me, you just want the maximum amount of money as a credit each month and just guess as to which purchases will fill up your points most efficiently.

This is a classic example of the [Knapsack Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem), where selecting the optimal set of charges to maximize the statement credit is NP-complete.  This script solves this problem and tells you exactly which charges to select to maximize your statement credit.

For now, you'll need to copy [this script](/amex-points.js) and paste it into the Chrome Console using [these instructions](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/console).

Please get in touch if you'd like to turn this into a Chrome Web Store add-on or something else that's more user-friendly.  Happy saving!
